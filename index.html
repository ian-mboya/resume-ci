					<h2>ABOUT ME (NEW PORTFOLIO SITE UNVEILING SOON)</h2>
					
                    <p>Technology and its evolution has always intrigued me in every way possible. From how we can use technology to solve humanity's problems to tailoring services and products that improve the well being of individuals. My compelling passion towards Information Technology and partly Computer Science has enabled me envision methodologies towards holistic approaches in harmonizing technology and people.
                         </p>
                         <p>I aim to gain working experience from industry related instituitions to help me further achieve this. I am self driven and well acquainted with delivering desired performance in a workspace. Learning as an adaptive measure is also another virtue I possess. Learning established workflows will add to my experience that I will use in Information Technology and Information Technology services. </p>
